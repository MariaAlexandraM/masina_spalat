2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell timer/num_0/PL_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) timer/num_0/cifra_reg[0]_C/CLR, timer/num_0/cifra_reg[1]_C/CLR, timer/num_0/cifra_reg[2]_C/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell timer/num_1/PL_reg_i_1__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) timer/num_1/cifra_reg[0]_C/CLR, timer/num_1/cifra_reg[1]_C/CLR, timer/num_1/cifra_reg[2]_C/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert
